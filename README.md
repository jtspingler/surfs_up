# surfs_up

## Overview
In this project we explored the power of data retrieval and storage in orer to analyze the temperatures in Oahu across the months of June and December. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to identify if there is a business opportunity for a surf and ice cream shop business. We are curious if this business can operate year-round rather than seasonally.

### Resources Utilized to Complete Analysis
