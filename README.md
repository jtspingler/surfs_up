# surfs_up

## Overview
In this project we explored the power of data retrieval and storage in orer to analyze the temperatures in Oahu across the months of June and December. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to identify if there is a business opportunity for a surf and ice cream shop business. We are curious if this business can operate year-round rather than seasonally.

### Resources Utilized to Complete Analysis

## Results

### Summary Statistics 

### June Statistics

![Fig1](https://github.com/jtspingler/surfs_up/blob/main/June%20stats.png)
- Average: 74.94 degrees
- High: 85.00 degrees
- # of Observations: 1700

### December Statistics

![Fig2](https://https://github.com/jtspingler/surfs_up/blob/main/Dec%20stats.png)
- Average: 71.04 degrees
- High: 83.00 degrees
- # of Observations: 1517

### Fare Counts by City Type
Using the data provided, we can see that on average the most expensive rides will occur in the rural areas. This can be explained by supply / demand, as there are not as many drivers or riders in urban areas. Our multiple-line graph shows total weekly fares for each city type. Urban cities have the highest revenue in comparison to suburban and rural cities which is also expected.

## Summary
These are my recommendations after analyzing the provided data.
1.	I would like to see some more data specifically as it related to dates and some of the trends we see around different times of the year. I would be curious to see if seasonality changed any of the outcomes that I said were mostly predictable when looking at this data.
2.	In order to run a successful operation in a new potential market, there are more data points I'd like to gather, especially as it relates to demographic information. This will help understand who the customers are and what types of people are purchasing our product. 
3.	There is value in understanding how some of our competitors have entered the market. The Rideshare market is fairly saturated and I'm sure there are lessons to be learned from previous expansions into new markets.
